Household Power Prediction â€” End-to-End ML Pipeline
Predict household global reactive power using smart meter data with a production-ready, adaptive ML system.
Tech Stack & Tools
Python | PyTorch Lightning | FastAPI + Uvicorn
Pandas / NumPy for data processing
SHAP / Integrated Gradients for explainability
Airflow for drift detection & automated retraining
Joblib for scaler persistence
Problem & Motivation
Short-term prediction of reactive power helps households and utilities optimize energy consumption and detect anomalies. This project demonstrates full ML engineering skills: feature engineering, model training, explainability, deployment, monitoring, and adaptive retraining.
Solution Overview
Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Parse timestamps, add temporal features (hour, day-of-week, weekend).
Compute lag features for power, sub-metering, and intensity.
Scale features and save to power_features.csv.
Model Training
Neural network (MLP) trained with PyTorch Lightning.
Best model and scaler persisted to artifacts_lightning/.
API Deployment with FastAPI
/predict: returns predicted reactive power.
/explain: returns feature contributions using SHAP.
Logs every request for auditing and drift monitoring.
Drift Detection & Automated Retraining
Airflow DAG checks for distribution drift in incoming prediction data.
If drift detected, retrains model using new + original data.
Updates API automatically with new model/scaler for continuous deployment.
